        <h1 class="article__title">Goal 6 of UNs Sustainability goals.</h1>
        <p class="article__text">
          Goal 6 of the UN's Sustainable Development Goals aims to ensure
          availability and sustainable management of water and sanitation for
          all. One of the key targets under this goal is to prevent and
          significantly reduce marine pollution of all kinds, including by
          nutrient pollution and marine debris. This is important for the
          preservation of sea creatures, as they can be greatly impacted by
          water pollution. Marine pollution can harm sea creatures directly,
          through ingestion of or entanglement in debris, or indirectly through
          the contamination of the food chain. Therefore, achieving Goal 6 can
          play a crucial role in ensuring the health and wellbeing of sea
          creatures and their ecosystems.
